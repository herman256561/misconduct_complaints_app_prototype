               Each municipality independently manages the recruitment, training, and
               oversight of its own police force in Allegheny County. While some
               police departments serve multiple municipalities, the majority have
               their own independent police force. This creates significant barriers
               to officer accountability in cases of tension due to the inconsistent
               and hyper-fragmented nature of complaint policies, procedures, and
               disciplinary actions. In 2021, the sum of total police expenditure was
               2.4 billion dollars. The county has a total of 2,246 officers with
               only 156 of them being part- time.
