            <h1>Misconduct Complaint in Allegheny County</h1>

              Each municipality independently manages the recruitment, training, and oversight of its own police force in Allegheny County. While some
              police departments serve multiple municipalities, the majority have their own independent police force. This creates significant barriers
              to officer accountability in cases of tension due to the inconsistent and hyper-fragmented nature of complaint policies, procedures, and
              disciplinary actions. In 2021, the sum of total police expenditure was 2.4 billion dollars. The county has a total of 2,246 officers with
              only 156 of them being part- time. 
              The absence of standardized policies in Allegheny County allows each municipality the autonomy to establish its own citizen complaint as per state law. 
              <br><br>As a result of this disordered process, citizens who have recently suffered from poor experiences with the police are left at a loss for where to go when seeking accountability. 
              They can check their local municipality website, however, the majority of these websites lack a dedicated citizen-complaint form, and even the ones that do often lack pieces of critical information. 
              Several departments even admit to having no complaint process for their residents to follow. This results in a community that lacks easy access to accountability. From our database, 78 municipalities did not have a system in place post complaint processing.
              <br><br>
              Out of 131 municipalities in this region, itâ€™s rare that they will tell the complainant who investigates the complaint. Only 32.8 percent tell complainants this information, mostly in a non-specific way. They also rarely commit to making an initial follow-up with complainants, with only 26.7 percent saying that they will. Municipalities in Allegheny County are even less likely to reveal their findings. Only 2.29 percent of municipalities list potential disciplinary actions taken against a law enforcement agent as a result of a complaint, and 9.16 percent say who decides the disciplinary action and whether the complainant will find out about the action that has taken place. Worse, only 2.2 percent of municipalities say that the public will find out about disciplinary actions. Even with a strong initial complaint process scores, municipalities often fail to provide effective next steps. Unfortunately, this limits the impact of filing complaints within the municipality. If Allegheny County wants residents to trust law enforcement, they need to make this part of the process more effective.
